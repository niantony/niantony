### Hi there ðŸ‘‹! I'm Antony

I am currently a sophomore studying and obtaining a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at **Purdue University**.

My interests within the industry lie in **fullstack development**. On the frontend, I enjoy creating beautiful and seamless user experiences and on the backend I enjoy working with databases and optimizing them.

Aside from the industry, my interests lie in several activities: weight lifting, personal finance, poker, the stock market, and more recently hiking.
